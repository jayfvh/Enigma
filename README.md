# Enigma - Created by Jason Van Humbeck

During World War II, the Germans famously employed the Enigma machine to encrypt and conceal their messages from adversaries. This proved incredibly successful, requiring years and significant advancements for the Allies, along with the help of the ground-breaking Turing machine, to decipher the code.

Inspired by a video discussing the Enigma machine, I began coding this project on January 11th. The idea of constructing an early encryption algorithm seemed intriguing. While I don't perceive the code as overly complex, the challenge lies in pushing the machine to its limits as a data structure. As a demonstration, I concluded the project by encrypting Shakespeare's "Hamlet" ("secretHamlet.txt") with the real rotor settings.

Despite the Enigma machine falling into the wrong hands, its circuit's complexity remains astounding and truly impressive. However, even more impressive is Alan Turing's Machine, which I plan to code in my upcoming free time. As a thought experiment, I encourage exploring the circuit for this machine and delving into the mathematics behind its unbreakability.

For those interested, the enigma.py file has the potential for developing a GUI atop it!
