# Enigma - Created by Jason Van Humbeck

Durring WW2 the germans famously used a machine: Enigma, to encript and hide their messages from their opposition.
This was increbly successfull, and it took years and major advancements for the allies, and the turing machine to
break the code, helping them win the war.

I decided to code this on Jan 11th, because I saw a video discissing the machine, and I thought it would be fun to try
and build an early encription algorithim. While, I dont belive this code is very difficult, I think it is intresting trying
to push the machine to its limits, as a data structure. To prove this, I concluded the project, by enrcripting shakespears, 
Hamlet ("secretHamlet.txt").

Even though enigma fell in the wrong hands, it is still amazing to see the complexity of this curcit, and is truly impressive.
Although, more impresive was Allen Turings, Turing Machine, which I will attempt to code next when I have free-time next. Although, I do encourage as a thought expirment to draw out the curcit for this machine, aswell as to try and figure out the math behind its unbreakability.

The emigma.py has capabilities if anyone decides to build a GUI ontop of it!
